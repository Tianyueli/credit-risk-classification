# credit-risk-classification

# Overview 
- This project, I used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
  
# Model building & Prediction
- I created a dataframe using the original data and separated y and X by "loan_status" column and all remaining attribute columns. I then splitted the data into training and testing sets and created a Logistic Regression Model with the original data. 
- Next I made predictions for testing data and calculated for the accuracy of model using testing data: accuracy result 0.992.
- I then evaluated the model’s performance by generating a confusion matrix and a classification report. Please see detailed analysis and findings below.

# Findings and Analysis 
- Based on the the results generated from the confusion matrix, the likelihood of this model getting the loan being healthy result correctly (loan_status = 0) is 99.4%: 583 / (110 + 583)

- How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?
- A value of 0 in the “loan_status” column means that the loan is healthy. A value of 1 means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.
